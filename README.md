# Linux Virtualization with KVM and QEMU  

In this repository, I store my **case scenarios** related to **Linux virtualization**, primarily using **KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) and QEMU (Quick Emulator)**.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Each file contains:  
- ✅ **Scenario description** with detailed steps.  
- 🛠 **Required software and dependencies** for execution.  
- ⚠️ **Errors encountered and their resolutions**.  
- 📷 **Screenshots and logs** for reference.  

This repository serves as a **learning resource** and a **proof of hands-on experience** in Linux virtualization.
